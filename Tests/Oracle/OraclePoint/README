    README file of the Test suite for ParetoLib
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The following file contains information about every data file used in the test
suite of ParetoLib for OraclePoint. Each file defines a OraclePoint:

2D/3D
-

ND
-


*** All the tests consider n-dimensional spaces where the range of each axe is [0,1]. ****

    File format
"""""""""""""""""
There are two kind of files (*.txt, *.bin):
- *.txt are textual human-readable files.
Each line of the file represents a point in the closure.
Every point is defined by a tuple with the format '(x, y, z)',
The dimension of the n-dimensional space is implicitly defined by the number of
coordinates in the tuple.

- *.bin are binary files created by the serialization of Oracles with the Python's Pickle library.
